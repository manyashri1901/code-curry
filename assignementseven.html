  <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>

  <p>
    HTML (<i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>) is used to create document on the 
    <a href="#">World Wide Web</a>. 
    <i>It is simply a collection of certain key words called "Tags" that are helpful in writing the 
    document to be displayed using a browser on Internet.</i> 
    HTML was developed by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> in 1992.
